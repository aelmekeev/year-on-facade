    <a href="https://year-on-facade.uk/">Back to the the collection</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, it's a collection of buildings with the year of (re-)construction on their facade.
    Or, more precisely, it's a collection of years on the dated buildings.
  </p>

  <p>
    The main page is the timeline from the first year in the collection until the current year.
    Green - found. Blue and White - not found. The main purpose of the Blue is to quickly grasp/compare
    the range of years for a single country/city.
  </p>

  <p>
    Click on any of the "cities" links, and you will see a similar view for cities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Statistics will be available when you click on any of the country/city links:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>years in the collection broken by decades</li>
    <li>link to the map with all the items tagged</li>
    <li>total number of years in the collection</li>
    <li>buildings listed in the heritage registries (dark green in the table)</li>
    <li>number of places visited</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    On the last point. Even though, according to <a href="https://github.com/aelmekeev/year-on-facade#rules">the rules</a>
    every item should be verifiable with Google Street View, I do use this collection as one of the main drivers for cycling/traveling.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is why if you click on any of the green squares, you will see a couple of photos,
    map, and Google Street View links, as well as (if available) a link to a heritage registry entry
    (e.g. <a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/">Historic England</a>)
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    That's it! Will it ever be complete? No idea. I feel that there are not so many items left in London,
    but I'm sure the UK should get me to 300+.
