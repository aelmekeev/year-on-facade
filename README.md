# Year on Facade

This is a collection of years on facades.

https://year-on-facade.uk/

## Rules

In order to be added to collection the location needs to meet the following requirements:

1. The year must be on facade and be part of the building and should be associated with it ([examples](https://www.instagram.com/year_on_facade/)):
    * Year of the construction / reconstruction, i.e. `erected`, `enlarged`, `rebuilt` :white_check_mark:
    * [Commemorative plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commemorative_plaque) :x:
    * Year when the organization located in the building was `established` :x:
2. Year must be written with arabic numerals.
3. The building must be located in administrative boundaries of particular city.
4. Be verifiable via Google Street View.
    * Note: only Street View and not "Photo Sphere"

It is OK to replace existing points in case the replacement:

1. is in the [heritage registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_heritage_registers) e.g. in [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/) or [Fredede og Bevaringsv√¶rdige Bygninger](https://www.kulturarv.dk/fbb/index.htm)
1. or makes distribution of the points on the map nicer (i.e. less crowdy)
