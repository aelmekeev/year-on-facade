# Colouring cities utils

This is a collection of utils that can help to generate list for items to review based on data extracts from [Colouring cities project](https://github.com/colouring-cities).

## Prerequisites

1. `brew install csvkit` to install [csvkit](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Instructions

Note that lists generated by these tools will exclude:

1. items where `date_year` is not the same as `facade_year`
2. items already in the collection for the specified city

### Initial review

1. download the data, e.g. [for London](https://colouring.london/data-extracts.html)
2. unzip archive and move `building_attributes.csv` to this folder
3. run `./initial_review.sh <City, default is London>`

`initial_review.json` file will be generated with the list of points to verify grouped by year.

### Checking only updates

1. download the data, e.g. [for London](https://colouring.london/data-extracts.html)
2. unzip archive and move `edit_history.csv` and `building_attributes.csv` to this folder
3. run `./updates_only.sh <City, default is London>`

`updates_only.json` file will be generated with the list of points to verify grouped by year.
